    <h4>FINANCIAL TERMS</h4>
    <p>You understand that use of the Services may result in charges to you for  the Spa Services that you receive from a Third Party Provider ("<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Charges</span></strong>"). After you have  received Spa Services via your use of the Services, SpaFoo will act as the  Third Party Provider's limited payment collection agent to facilitate your  payment of the applicable Charges to such Third Party Provider.

Charges will be inclusive of applicable sales  or other taxes where required by law. Charges paid by you are final and  non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by SpaFoo.</p>
    <p>All Charges are due immediately and payment will be facilitated by SpaFoo  using the preferred payment method designated in your Account.&nbsp; After processing of any Charges, SpaFoo will  send you a receipt by email. If your primary Account payment method is  determined to be expired, invalid or otherwise not able to be charged, you  agree that SpaFoo may, as the Third Party Provider's limited payment collection  agent, use a secondary payment method in your Account, if available.</p>
    <p>As between you and SpaFoo, SpaFoo reserves the right to establish, remove  and/or revise Charges for any or all Spa Services obtained via the Services at  any time in SpaFoo's sole discretion.

    <p>This payment structure is intended to fully compensate the Third Party  Provider for the Spa Services provided. SpaFoo does not designate any portion  of your payment as a tip or gratuity to the Third Party Provider. Any  representation by SpaFoo (in the Applications or in SpaFoo's marketing  materials) to the effect that tipping is "voluntary" and/or "not  required" is not intended to suggest that SpaFoo provides any additional  amounts, beyond those described above, to any Third Party Provider. You  understand and agree that, while you are free to provide additional payment as  a gratuity to any Third Party Provider who provides you with Spa Services  obtained via the Services, you are under no obligation to do so. Gratuities are  voluntary. After you have received Spa Services obtained via the Services, you  will have the opportunity to rate your Spa Service and leave additional  feedback about your Third Party Provider.</p>
