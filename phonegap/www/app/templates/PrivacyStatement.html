<h3>Use of Cookies</h3>
<p>The SpaFoo website use "cookies" to help you  personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on  your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or  deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can  only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>
<p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a  convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the  web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you  personalize SpaFoo pages, or register with SpaFoo site or services, a cookie  helps SpaFoo to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This  simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing  addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same SpaFoo  website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can  easily use the SpaFoo features that you customized.</p>
<p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web  browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser  setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you  may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the SpaFoo Services.</p>
<h3>Security of your  Personal Information</h3>
<p>SpaFoo secures your personal information from unauthorized  access, use or disclosure. SpaFoo secures the personally identifiable  information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure  environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When  personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites,  it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer  (SSL) protocol.&nbsp; This prevents your  information from being read during transmission over the internet.</p>
<h3>Changes to this  Statement</h3>
<p>SpaFoo reserves the right to modify this Statement of  Privacy at any time in our discretion by posting the modified policy on this website,  which policy will be effective upon posting, as indicated by the "Effective  Date" at the top of this page.&nbsp; As  we may make changes from time to time, we suggest that you frequently review  the Statement of Privacy.&nbsp; By using the Services  after the effective date of any modification to the Statement of Privacy, you  consent to the collection, use, and sharing of information as described in the  modified Statement of Privacy.</p>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
